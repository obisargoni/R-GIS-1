  abstract = {Experts predict that new automobiles will be capable of driving themselves under limited conditions within 5\textendash{}10years, and under most conditions within 10\textendash{}20years. Automation may affect road vehicle energy consumption and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in a host of ways, positive and negative, by causing changes in travel demand, vehicle design, vehicle operating profiles, and choices of fuels. In this paper, we identify specific mechanisms through which automation may affect travel and energy demand and resulting GHG emissions and bring them together using a coherent energy decomposition framework. We review the literature for estimates of the energy impacts of each mechanism and, where the literature is lacking, develop our own estimates using engineering and economic analysis. We consider how widely applicable each mechanism is, and quantify the potential impact of each mechanism on a common basis: the percentage change it is expected to cause in total GHG emissions from light-duty or heavy-duty vehicles in the U.S. Our primary focus is travel related energy consumption and emissions, since potential lifecycle impacts are generally smaller in magnitude. We explore the net effects of automation on emissions through several illustrative scenarios, finding that automation might plausibly reduce road transport GHG emissions and energy use by nearly half \textendash{} or nearly double them \textendash{} depending on which effects come to dominate. We also find that many potential energy-reduction benefits may be realized through partial automation, while the major energy/emission downside risks appear more likely at full automation. We close by presenting some implications for policymakers and identifying priority areas for further research.},

  abstract = {Objective: The aim of this study was to review existing research into driver control transitions and to determine the time it takes drivers to resume control from a highly automated vehicle in noncritical scenarios.
Background: Contemporary research has moved from an inclusive design approach to adhering only to mean/median values when designing control transitions in automated driving. Research into control transitions in highly automated driving has focused on urgent scenarios where drivers are given a relatively short time span to respond to a request to resume manual control. We found a paucity in research into more frequent scenarios for control transitions, such as planned exits from highway systems.
Method: Twenty-six drivers drove two scenarios with an automated driving feature activated. Drivers were asked to read a newspaper, or to monitor the system, and to relinquish, or resume, control from the automation when prompted by vehicle systems.
Results: Significantly longer control transition times were found between driving with and without secondary tasks. Control transition times were substantially longer than those reported in the peer-reviewed literature.
Conclusion: We found that drivers take longer to resume control when under no time pressure compared with that reported in the literature. Moreover, we found that drivers occupied by a secondary task exhibit larger variance and slower responses to requests to resume control. Workload scores implied optimal workload.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.trf.2014.09.005},
  abstract = {A driving simulator study was designed to investigate drivers' ability to resume control from a highly automated vehicle in two conditions: (i) when automation was switched off and manual control was required at a system-based, regular interval and (ii) when transition to manual was based on the length of time drivers were looking away from the road ahead. In addition to studying the time it took drivers to successfully resume control from the automated system, eye tracking data were used to observe visual attention to the surrounding environment and the pattern of drivers' eye fixations as manual control was resumed in the two conditions. Results showed that drivers' pattern of eye movement fixations remained variable for some time after automation was switched off, if disengagement was actually based on drivers' distractions away from the road ahead. When disengagement was more predictable and system-based, drivers' attention towards the road centre was higher and more stable. Following a lag of around 10 s, drivers' lateral control of driving and steering corrections (as measured by SDLP and high frequency component of steering, respectively) were more stable when transition to manual control was predictable and based on a fixed time. Whether automation transition to manual was based on a fixed or variable interval, it took drivers around 35\textendash{}40 s to stabilise their lateral control of the vehicle. The results of this study indicate that if drivers are out of the loop due to control of the vehicle in a limited self-driving situation (Level 3 automation), their ability to regain control of the vehicle is better if they are expecting automation to be switched off. As regular disengagement of automation is not a particularly practical method for keeping drivers in the loop, future research should consider how to best inform drivers of their obligation to resume control of driving from an automated system.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.trf.2011.11.007},
  abstract = {The objective of this research is to develop and test a theoretical framework for modelling pedestrian crossing behaviour along trips in urban areas. The general question examined concerns the estimation of the probability to cross at each alternative location within a pedestrian's crossing choice set, associated with each crossing decision made along an urban trip. A topological consideration of urban road networks and pedestrian trips is opted for, which enables the overall parameterisation of the problem and the estimation of the number and type of crossings along a pedestrian trip. On the basis of certain topological properties of pedestrian trips, an algorithm is then developed for determining the set of choice alternatives for each crossing along the trip. Finally, specific techniques from the family of discrete choice models are proposed for modelling the choice of a crossing location from the available alternatives in each case. Different hypotheses are examined with respect to road crossing decision making process (sequential or hierarchical decision making) and various models are tested in each case (multinomial, nested, or cross-nested models). For the development of the proposed models, a field survey is carried out, in order to collect detailed data on pedestrian trips and crossings in urban areas per road network, traffic conditions and pedestrian characteristics. The modelling results reveal increased probability of crossing at the beginning of the trip, a tendency to postpone crossings in longer trips, especially for pedestrians with increased walking speeds, increased probability of crossing at signalised junctions, when available, and increased probability of crossing at mid-block in low traffic volumes and on one-way roads. Moreover, the hypothesis of sequential decision making is proved to be more promising for the description of pedestrians' crossing choices along urban trips.},

@article{sunModelingMotoristPedestrianInteraction2003,
  title = {Modeling of {{Motorist}}-{{Pedestrian Interaction}} at {{Uncontrolled Mid}}-Block {{Crosswalks}}},
  abstract = {The purpose of this paper is to develop realistic models for pedestrian motorist interaction at an uncontrolled two-lane mid-block crosswalk. Two different phenomena are studied for the motorist-pedestrian interaction: the attributes which pedestrians consider in accepting gaps and the attributes in motorist yield behavior. Different methodologies for modeling Pedestrian Gap Acceptance (PGA) and the Motorist Yield (MOY) are proposed. For the PGA, the first model is deterministic and solely depends on the gap sizes that are accepted or rejected by pedestrians. The second model is probabilistic and the probability of accepting a gap is calculated as a random variable from a distribution that best fits the data. The third model uses a binary logit approach; multi-attribute regression analyses are performed to capture the decision making process of the pedestrian. Two models are proposed to capture the MOY behavior: a discrete probability model and a MOY binary logit model. These models are integrated using a System Dynamic Interaction (SDI) which shows the inter-dependency of both the PGA and MOY models and gives the final decision making of the system. Further, an intuition is also given by the SDI model for building a simulation framework for modeling these interactions. A field study was conducted to collect the data of different attributes using a set of video cameras at a typical unsignalized mid-block crosswalk. This data was used to calibrate and validate the different proposed models. The results show that PGA and MOY binary logit models perform better than the other models. Moreover, additional insights are provided into the PGA and MOY behavior based on the data.},

  abstract = {This research explores factors associated with driver yielding behavior at unsignalized pedestrian crossings and develops predictive models for yielding by using logistic regression. It considers the effect of variables describing driver attributes, pedestrian characteristics, and concurrent conditions at the crosswalk on yield response. Special consideration is given to ``vehicle dynamics constraints'' that form a threshold for the potential to yield. Similarities to driver reaction in response to the amber indication at a signalized intersection are identified. The logit models were developed from data collected at two unsignalized midblock crosswalks in North Carolina. The data include before and after observations of two pedestrian safety treatments, an in-street pedestrian crossing sign and pedestrian-actuated in-roadway warning lights. The analysis suggests that drivers are more likely to yield to assertive pedestrians who walk briskly in their approach to the crosswalk. In turn, the yield probability is reduced with higher speeds, with deceleration rates, and if vehicles are traveling in platoons. The treatment effects proved to be significant and increased the propensity of drivers to yield, but their effectiveness may be dependent on whether the pedestrian activates the treatment. The results of this research provide new insights into the complex interaction of pedestrians and vehicles at unsignalized intersections and have implications for future work toward predictive models for driver yielding behavior. The developed logit models can provide the basis for representing driver yielding behavior in a microsimulation modeling environment.

In broad terms, the theory is found to be well supported by empirical evidence. Intentions to perform behaviors of different kinds can be predicted with high accuracy from attitudes toward the behavior, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control; and these intentions, together with perceptions of behavioral control, account for considerable variance in actual behavior. Attitudes, subjective norms, and perceived behavioral control are shown to be related to appropriate sets of salient behavioral, normative, and control beliefs about the behavior, but the exact nature of these relations is still uncertain. Expectancy-value formulations are found to be only partly successful in dealing with these relations. Optimal rescaling of expectancy and value measures is offered as a means of dealing with measurement limitations. Finally, inclusion of past behavior in the prediction equation is shown to provide a means of testing the theory's sufficiency, another issue that remains unresolved. The limited available evidence concerning this question shows that the theory is predicting behavior quite well in comparison to the ceiling imposed by behavioral reliability.},

Since the seventies, IS research has contributed to a better understanding of this process and its outcomes. The early efforts concentrated on the identification of factors that facilitated IS use. This produced a long list of items that proved to be of little practical value. It became obvious that, for practical reasons, the factors had to be grouped into a model in a way that would facilitate analysis of IS use. In 1985, Fred Davis suggested the technology acceptance model (TAM). It examines the mediating role of perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness in their relation between systems characteristics (external variables) and the probability of system use (an indicator of system success). More recently, Davis proposed a new version of his model: TAM2. It includes subjective norms, and was tested with longitudinal research designs. Overall the two explain about 40\% of system's use. Analysis of empirical research using TAM shows that results are not totally consistent or clear. This suggests that significant factors are not included in the models. We conclude that TAM is a useful model, but has to be integrated into a broader one which would include variables related to both human and social change processes, and to the adoption of the innovation model.},

  abstract = {This study aims to explore the potential of using big data in advancing the pedestrian risk analysis including the investigation of contributing factors and the hotspot identification. Massive amounts of data of Manhattan from a variety of sources were collected, integrated, and processed, including taxi trips, subway turnstile counts, traffic volumes, road network, land use, sociodemographic, and social media data. The whole study area was uniformly split into grid cells as the basic geographical units of analysis. The cell-structured framework makes it easy to incorporate rich and diversified data into risk analysis. The cost of each crash, weighted by injury severity, was assigned to the cells based on the relative distance to the crash site using a kernel density function. A tobit model was developed to relate grid-cell-specific contributing factors to crash costs that are left-censored at zero. The potential for safety improvement (PSI) that could be obtained by using the actual crash cost minus the cost of ``similar'' sites estimated by the tobit model was used as a measure to identify and rank pedestrian crash hotspots. The proposed hotspot identification method takes into account two important factors that are generally ignored, i.e., injury severity and effects of exposure indicators. Big data, on the one hand, enable more precise estimation of the effects of risk factors by providing richer data for modeling, and on the other hand, enable large-scale hotspot identification with higher resolution than conventional methods based on census tracts or traffic analysis zones.},

  doi = {10.1016/j.aap.2013.07.030},
  abstract = {This work examines the relationship between 3-year pedestrian crash counts across Census tracts in Austin, Texas, and various land use, network, and demographic attributes, such as land use balance, residents' access to commercial land uses, sidewalk density, lane-mile densities (by roadway class), and population and employment densities (by type). The model specification allows for region-specific heterogeneity, correlation across response types, and spatial autocorrelation via a Poisson-based multivariate conditional auto-regressive (CAR) framework and is estimated using Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods. Least-squares regression estimates of walk-miles traveled per zone serve as the exposure measure. Here, the Poisson-lognormal multivariate CAR model outperforms an aspatial Poisson-lognormal multivariate model and a spatial model (without cross-severity correlation), both in terms of fit and inference. Positive spatial autocorrelation emerges across neighborhoods, as expected (due to latent heterogeneity or missing variables that trend in space, resulting in spatial clustering of crash counts). In comparison, the positive aspatial, bivariate cross correlation of severe (fatal or incapacitating) and non-severe crash rates reflects latent covariates that have impacts across severity levels but are more local in nature (such as lighting conditions and local sight obstructions), along with spatially lagged cross correlation. Results also suggest greater mixing of residences and commercial land uses is associated with higher pedestrian crash risk across different severity levels, ceteris paribus, presumably since such access produces more potential conflicts between pedestrian and vehicle movements. Interestingly, network densities show variable effects, and sidewalk provision is associated with lower severe-crash rates.},

Planners need practical tools to consider the impact of development on pedestrian safety, a key requirement for the promotion of walking. Simple bivariate models have been used to predict changes in vehicle-pedestrian injury collisions based on changes in traffic volume. We describe the development of a multivariate, area-level regression model of vehicle-pedestrian injury collisions based on environmental and population data in 176 San Francisco, California census tracts. Predictor variables examined included street, land use, and population characteristics, including commute behaviors. The final model explained approximately 72\% of the systematic variation in census-tract vehicle-pedestrian injury collisions and included measures of traffic volume, arterial streets without transit, land area, proportion of land area zoned for neighborhood commercial and residential-neighborhood commercial uses, employee and resident populations, proportion of people living in poverty and proportion aged 65 and older. We have begun to apply this model to predict area-level change in vehicle-pedestrian injury collisions associated with land use development and transportation planning decisions.},

  abstract = {Based on the theory of planned behavior, pedestrians' attitudes towards traffic violations and self-ratings of violations, errors and lapses were measured amongst a sample of 146 pedestrians. The evaluation of the planned behavior model using EQS showed a significant fit ($\chi$2(11)=16.04 p=0.14; normalfitindex=0.937). The reported violations, errors and lapses appears causally related to the intention to violate regulations, and this in turn with positive attitudes, subjective norm and perceived behavioral control. Young people have a more positive attitude towards committing violations as pedestrians than adults and perceive the subjective norm to be less inhibitory, have less control over violations, have a more positive intention to commit violations, and report more violations, errors, and lapses than adults. Men report more frequent violations of the traffic rules than women do. The conclusion is drawn that pedestrians, and in particular young males, are at least in part responsible for the high accident rates and remedial actions are suggested.},

There is generally a positive effect on retailing, with shops inside pedestrian areas being more successful than those outside. Part of the increased turnover is transferred to the landlord, in the form of higher market rents. More extensive schemes have more substantial positive effects. However, there can be a reduction in turnover during a transition period of 1-2 years, and the effects can be unfavourable for fringe shops just outside the developed area, unless the scheme is carefully designed.},

  abstract = {Existing theories relating patterns of pedestrian and vehicular movement to urban form characterise the problem in terms of flows to and from 'attractor' land uses. This paper contains evidence in support of a new 'configurational' paradigm in which a primary property of the form of the urban grid is to privilege certain spaces over others for through movement. In this way it is suggested that the configuration of the urban grid itself is the main generator of patterns of movement. Retail land uses are then located to take advantage of the opportunities offered by the passing trade and may well act as multipliers on the basic pattern of 'natural movement' generated by the grid configuration. The configurational correlates of movement patterns are found to be measures of global properties of the grid with the 'space syntax' measure of 'integration' consistently found to be the most important. This has clear implications for urban design suggesting that if we wish to design for well used urban space, then it is not the local properties of a space that are important in the main but its configurational relations to the larger urban system.},

Pedestrians can move freely only at small pedestrian densities. Otherwise their motion is affected by repulsive interactions with other pedestrians, giving rise to self-organization phenomena. Examples of the resulting patterns of motion are separate lanes of uniform walking direction in crowds of oppositely moving pedestrians or oscillations of the passing direction at bottlenecks. If pedestrians leave footprints on deformable ground (for example, in green spaces such as public parks) this additionally causes attractive interactions which are mediated by modifications of their environment. In such cases, systems of pedestrian trails will evolve over time. The corresponding computer simulations are a valuable tool for developing optimized pedestrian facilities and way systems.},
